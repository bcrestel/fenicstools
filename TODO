TODO list


    - ACOUSTIC:
* Implement inverse pb with TV regularization
right now returns error b/c no preconditioner defined for TV
see what was done for imaging exple
* Try implement some assembly in Hessian matvec to speedup code 
(hessianb takes 60% cpu time for large-ish pbs)
* Same idea for time-iteration in acousticwave solver
* Solve multiscale example as test case
* Use Marmousi data 
(see /home/ben/Work/Research/UT-Austin/Waves/Marmousi/fromNick)
* Boundary conditions: implement ABC/PML in joint inversion
* Solve inversion with TV regularization (primal-dual or Split Bregman?)
* Study joint regularizers
* L-BFGS (or BFGS for now) as preconditioner of Newton-CG system ?
* implement misfit with blurring kernel
* GLL integration points in Fenics


    - BAYESIAN:
* Implement elliptic pb with log-permeability (i.e., -div(exp(m)grad(u))) and mixed (Dirich-Neum) BCs.
* Check convergence of fwd pb.
* Check/clarify definition of prior covariance + check sampling (compute mean and variance)
* Run MCMC
