TODO list

    - CHECKS:
* Build unit test for: prior, observation operator,... (serial and parallel)
* Parallel computations (what solver?), scaling, ...


    - GENERAL:
* Test TV with denoising problem
* Implement primal-dual solver for TV regularization


    - ACOUSTIC:
* Implement 1d wave exple with a layer to observe bouncing wave.
* profile parallel
* Assemble gradient
* Code C++ version of fwd and adj pbs


    - BAYESIAN:
* Implement elliptic pb with log-permeability (i.e., -div(exp(m)grad(u))) and mixed (Dirich-Neum) BCs.
* Check convergence of fwd pb.
* Check/clarify definition of prior covariance + check sampling (compute mean and variance)
* Run MCMC
