TODO list
* Check Lumped Matrix Solver by looking at spectrum (invMdiag * M)
* acoustic wave equation: 
    - Check polynomial order and time-stepper -> Specfem doc (time-error seems
      to be limiting factor right now)
    - keep modifying test cases to include varying wave speed
    - profile serial/parallel
    - test adjoint problem
    - decide on source terms
    - start inverse problem (first zero-Neumann)
* Clarify point of solver in parallel (see examples/poisson_..._contobs_parallel2.py)
* Build unit test for: prior, observation operator,... (serial and parallel)
* implement mixed (Dirich-Neum) BCs in Poisson pb

* Bayesian example, sampling, ...
* multiple sources (re-think global variables in parallel; too much comm right now)

* Helmholtz example (?)
