TODO list

    - CHECKS:
* Build unit test for: prior, observation operator,... (serial and parallel)
* Parallel computations (what solver?), scaling, ...


    - DENOISING:
* Implement denoising with Tikhonov regularization
* Implement primal-dual solver for TV regularization


    - ACOUSTIC:
* Add ABC terms to gradient
* Check Hessian (wrt FD) + add ABC terms
* Code C++ version of fwd and adj pbs
* profile parallel


    - BAYESIAN:
* Implement elliptic pb with log-permeability (i.e., -div(exp(m)grad(u))) and mixed (Dirich-Neum) BCs.
* Check convergence of fwd pb.
* Check/clarify definition of prior covariance + check sampling (compute mean and variance)
* Run MCMC
