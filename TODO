TODO list

    - CHECKS:
* Build unit test for: prior, observation operator,... (serial and parallel)
* Parallel computations (what solver?), scaling, ...



    - ACOUSTIC:
* Keep modifying test cases to include varying wave speed (especially abc)
* Create and check convergence of point source w/ Ricker wavelet.
* Better time-stepper (see Hughes & Specfem)? Check requirement for size Dx
* profile serial/parallel
* Assemble gradient



    - BAYESIAN:
* Implement elliptic pb with log-permeability (i.e., -div(exp(m)grad(u))) and mixed (Dirich-Neum) BCs.
* Check convergence of fwd pb.
* Check/clarify definition of prior covariance + check sampling (compute mean and variance)
* Run MCMC
