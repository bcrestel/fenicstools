TODO list

    - JOINT:
* Boundary conditions: implement ABC/PML in joint inversion


    - ACOUSTIC:
* Check time-filter formulation
* Check noise application
* Improve performance of some steps of inversion:
    -Try implement some assembly in Hessian matvec to speedup code 
(hessianb takes 60% cpu time for large-ish pbs)
    - Same idea for time-iteration in acousticwave solver
* Solve multiscale example as test case
* Use Marmousi data 
(see /home/ben/Work/Research/UT-Austin/Waves/Marmousi/fromNick)
* L-BFGS (or BFGS for now) as preconditioner of Newton-CG system ?
Maybe worthwhile with TV regularization
* implement misfit with blurring kernel
* GLL integration points in Fenics


    - HESSIAN:
* Run with 1src (top-left corner) / 1rcv (bott-right corner); 4Hz, 8Hz (see Omar's email)
    MAP point completely unrealistic in that case (4Hz and 8Hz)
    Should compute at target parameter
    Or is this setting informative of anything at all?
