TODO list

    - DENOISING:
* create separate class for primal-dual (cleaner)


    - ACOUSTIC:
* define 'solver' fct in objectiveacoustic (or elsewhere) to simplify misc codes
* investigate how to export a matrix from fenics
* Assemble Hessian for different frequencies to compare how it looks like
* compute spectrum Hessian with mrhs to compare with single src (running on moench)
* Boundary conditions: implement ABC/PML in joint inversion
* implement misfit with blurring kernel
* GLL integration points in Fenics
* Code C++ version of fwd and adj pbs (?)


    - BAYESIAN:
* Implement elliptic pb with log-permeability (i.e., -div(exp(m)grad(u))) and mixed (Dirich-Neum) BCs.
* Check convergence of fwd pb.
* Check/clarify definition of prior covariance + check sampling (compute mean and variance)
* Run MCMC
