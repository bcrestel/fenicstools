TODO list
* acoustic wave equation: continue debugging (convergence analysis for simple solution -> needs to check exact solution)
when code works re-apply temporary corrections (BCs, rhs computation, ....)
* Clarify point of solver in parallel (see examples/poisson_..._contobs_parallel2.py)
* Build unit test for: prior, observation operator,... (serial and parallel)
* implement mixed (Dirich-Neum) BCs in Poisson pb

* Bayesian example, sampling, ...
* multiple sources (re-think global variables in parallel; too much comm right now)

* Helmholtz example (?)
