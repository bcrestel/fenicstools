TODO list

    - CHECKS:
* Build unit test for: prior, observation operator,... (serial and parallel)
* Parallel computations (what solver?), scaling, ...
* Compare Python vs C++ implementations for speed of assembly
* Automatic Differentiation / dolfin-adjoint


    - DENOISING:
* Implement primal-dual solver for TV regularization


    - ACOUSTIC:
* Look at dolfin-adjoint
* Check ABC terms to gradient and Hessian
* implement misfit with blurring kernel
* GLL integration points in Fenics
* profile + improve gradient and Hessian computation steps
* Code C++ version of fwd and adj pbs (?)


    - BAYESIAN:
* Implement elliptic pb with log-permeability (i.e., -div(exp(m)grad(u))) and mixed (Dirich-Neum) BCs.
* Check convergence of fwd pb.
* Check/clarify definition of prior covariance + check sampling (compute mean and variance)
* Run MCMC
